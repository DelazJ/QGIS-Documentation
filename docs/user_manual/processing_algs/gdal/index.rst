`GDAL`_ (Geospatial Data Abstraction Library) is a translator library
for raster and vector geospatial data formats.
Algorithms in the Processing Framework are derived from the
`GDAL raster programs <https://gdal.org/en/stable/programs/index.html#raster-programs>`_
and `GDAL vector programs <https://gdal.org/en/stable/programs/index.html#vector-programs>`_.
