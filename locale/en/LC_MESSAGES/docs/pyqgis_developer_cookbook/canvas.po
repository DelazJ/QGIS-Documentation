"The Map canvas widget is probably the most important widget within QGIS "
"because it shows the map composed from overlaid map layers and allows "
"interaction with the map and layers. The canvas always shows a part of "
"the map defined by the current canvas extent. The interaction is done "
"through the use of **map tools**: there are tools for panning, zooming, "
"identifying layers, measuring, vector editing and others. Similar to "
"other graphics programs, there is always one tool active and the user can"
" switch between the available tools."

"The map canvas is implemented with the :class:`QgsMapCanvas "
"<qgis.gui.QgsMapCanvas>` class in the :pyqgis:`qgis.gui <gui>` module. "
"The implementation is based on the Qt Graphics View framework. This "
"framework generally provides a surface and a view where custom graphics "
"items are placed and user can interact with them.  We will assume that "
"you are familiar enough with Qt to understand the concepts of the "
"graphics scene, view and items. If not, please read the `overview of the "
"framework <https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/graphicsview.html>`_."

"Whenever the map has been panned, zoomed in/out (or some other action "
"that triggers a refresh), the map is rendered again within the current "
"extent. The layers are rendered to an image (using the "
":class:`QgsMapRendererJob <qgis.core.QgsMapRendererJob>` class) and that "
"image is displayed on the canvas. The :class:`QgsMapCanvas "
"<qgis.gui.QgsMapCanvas>` class also controls refreshing of the rendered "
"map. Besides this item which acts as a background, there may be more "
"**map canvas items**."

"Typical map canvas items are rubber bands (used for measuring, vector "
"editing etc.) or vertex markers. The canvas items are usually used to "
"give visual feedback for map tools, for example, when creating a new "
"polygon, the map tool creates a rubber band canvas item that shows the "
"current shape of the polygon. All map canvas items are subclasses of "
":class:`QgsMapCanvasItem <qgis.gui.QgsMapCanvasItem>`  which adds some "
"more functionality to the basic ``QGraphicsItem`` objects."

"This produces a standalone window with map canvas. It can be also "

"file. The ``pyuic5`` utility will take care of it. This is a very "
