"QGIS Server is an open source WMS, WFS, OGC API for Features 1.0 (WFS3) "
"and WCS implementation that, in addition, implements advanced "
"cartographic features for thematic mapping. QGIS Server is a FastCGI/CGI "
"(Common Gateway Interface) application written in C++ that works together"
" with a web server (e.g., Apache, Nginx). It has Python plugin support "
"allowing for fast and efficient development and deployment of new "
"features."

"QGIS Server uses QGIS as back end for the GIS logic and for map "
"rendering. Furthermore, the Qt library is used for graphics and for "
"platform-independent C++ programming. In contrast to other WMS software, "
"the QGIS Server uses cartographic rules as a configuration language, both"
" for the server configuration and for the user-defined cartographic "
"rules."
