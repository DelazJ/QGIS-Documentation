"A Web Mapping Service (WMS) is a service hosted on a remote server. "
"Similar to a website, you can access it as long as you have a connection "

" map."

"From the lesson on plugins, you will remember that it's possible to load "

msgid ""
"This is how a WMS works: it's a map, similar to a normal map on paper, "
"that you receive as an image. What usually happens is that you have "
"vector layers, which QGIS renders as a map. But using a WMS, those vector"
" layers are on the WMS server, which renders it as a map and sends that "
"map to you as an image.  QGIS can display this image, but can't change "
"its symbology, because all that is handled on the server."

msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/training_manual/online_resources/wms.rst:154
msgid ""
"On the other hand, you can't change the symbology if you don't like it, "
"and if things change on the WMS server, then they'll change on your map "
"as well. This is why you sometimes want to use a Web Feature Service "
"(WFS) instead, which gives you vector layers separately, and not as part "
"of a WMS-style map."
