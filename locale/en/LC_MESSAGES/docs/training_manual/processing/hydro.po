"In this lesson we will perform some hydrological analysis. This analysis "
"will be used in some of the following lessons, as it constitutes a very "
"good example of an analysis workflow, and we will use it to demonstrate "
"some advanced features."

"Objectives: Starting with a DEM, we are going to extract a channel "
"network, delineate watersheds and calculate some statistics."

"The first thing is to load the project with the lesson data, which just "
"contains a DEM."

"The first module to execute is *Catchment area* (in some SAGA versions it"
" is called *Flow accumulation (Top Down)*). You can use any of the others"
" named *Catchment area*. They have different algorithms underneath, but "
"the results are basically the same."

"Select the DEM in the :guilabel:`Elevation` field, and leave the default "
"values for the rest of the parameters."

"Some algorithms calculate many layers, but the *Catchment Area* layer is "
"the only one we will be using. You can get rid of the other ones if you "

msgid "The rendering of the layer is not very informative."

msgid ""
"To know why, you can have a look at the histogram and you will see that "
"values are not evenly distributed (there are a few cells with very high "
"value, those corresponding to the channel network). Use the "
":guilabel:`Raster calculator` algorithm to calculate the logarithm of the"
" catchment value area and you will get a layer with much more information"

"The catchment area (also known as flow accumulation) can be used to set a"
" threshold for channel initiation. This can be done using the "
":guilabel:`Channel network` algorithm."

":guilabel:`Initiation grid`: use the catchment area layer and not the "

"If you increase the :guilabel:`Initiation threshold` value, you will get "
"a more sparse channel network. If you decrease it, you will get a denser "

"The image above shows just the resulting vector layer and the DEM, but "
"there should be also a raster layer with the same channel network. That "
"raster will be, in fact, the layer we will be using."

msgid ""
"Now, we will use the :guilabel:`Watersheds basins` algorithm to delineate"
" the subbasins corresponding to that channel network, using as outlet "

"corresponding parameters dialog."

msgid ""
"Now, let's try to compute statistics about the elevation values in one of"
" the subbasins. The idea is to have a layer that just represents the "
"elevation within that subbasin and then pass it to the module that "
"calculates those statistics."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"First, let's clip the original DEM with the polygon representing a "
"subbasin. We will use the :guilabel:`Clip raster with polygon` algorithm."
" If we select a single subbasin polygon and then call the clipping "
"algorithm, we can clip the DEM to the area covered by that polygon, since"
" the algorithm is aware of the selection."
