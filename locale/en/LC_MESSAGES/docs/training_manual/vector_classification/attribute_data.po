"Vector data is arguably the most common kind of data in the daily use of "
"GIS. The vector model represents the location and shape of geographic "
"features using points, lines and polygons (and for 3D data also surfaces "
"and volumes), while their other properties are included as attributes "
"(often presented as a table in QGIS)."

"Up to now, none of the changes we have made to the map have been "
"influenced by the objects that are being shown. In other words, all the "
