"Creating maps is one of the \"business ends\" of QGIS. Map views are "
"canvases to visualize spatial layers loaded in the project, with the "
"various rendering settings applied to them. They can be of :ref:`2D "
"<label_mapview>` or :ref:`3D <label_3dmapview>` type or plotted along a "
":ref:`profile line <label_elevation_profile_view>`, show different scale "
"or extent, or display a different set of the loaded layers thanks to "
":ref:`map themes <map_themes>`."
