"All algorithms (including models) can be executed as a batch process. "
"That is, they can be executed using not just a single set of inputs, but "
"several of them, executing the algorithm as many times as needed. This is"
" useful when processing large amounts of data, since it is not necessary "
"to launch the algorithm many times from the toolbox."

"Executing a batch process is similar to performing a single execution of "
"an algorithm. Parameter values have to be defined, but in this case we "
"need not just a single value for each parameter, but a set of them "
"instead, one for each time the algorithm has to be executed. Values are "
"introduced using a table like the one shown next, where each row is an "
"iteration and columns are the parameters of the algorithm."
