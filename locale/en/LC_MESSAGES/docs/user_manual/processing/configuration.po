":guilabel:`Prefer output filename for layer names`. The name of each "
"resulting layer created by an algorithm is defined by the algorithm "

"output name will be used, no matter which input layer is used. In other "
"cases, the name might depend on the name of the input layer or some of "
"the parameters used to run the algorithm. If this checkbox is checked, "
"the name will be taken from the output filename instead. Notice that, if "
"the output is saved to a temporary file, the filename of this temporary "

"empty, so all output layers are added to different places in the "
":guilabel:`Layers` panel, depending on the item that is active when "
