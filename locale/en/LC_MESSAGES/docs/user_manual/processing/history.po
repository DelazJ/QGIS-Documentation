"Every time you execute an algorithm, information about the process is "
"stored in the history manager. The date and time of the execution are "
"saved, along with the parameters used, making it is easy to track and "
"control all the work that has been developed using the Processing "
"framework, and to reproduce it."

"Process information is kept as a command-line expression, even if the "
"algorithm was launched from the toolbox. This makes it useful for those "
"learning how to use the command-line interface, since they can call an "
"algorithm using the toolbox and then check the history manager to see how"
" it could be called from the command line."

"these easily and then restore them later by pasting the values over an "
"algorithm dialog."

"Third-party algorithms are usually executed by using their command-line "
"interfaces, which communicate with the user via the console. Although "
"that console is not shown, usually a full dump of it is written to the "
"log each time you run one of those algorithms. To avoid cluttering the "
"log with that information, you can disable it for each provider in the "
"settings dialog."
