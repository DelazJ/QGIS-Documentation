"The *model designer* allows you to create complex models using a simple "
"and easy-to-use interface. When working with a GIS, most analysis "
"operations are not isolated, rather part of a chain of operations. Using "
"the model designer, that chain of operations can be wrapped into a single"
" process, making it convenient to execute later with a different set of "
"inputs. No matter how many steps and different algorithms it involves, a "
"model is executed as a single algorithm, saving time and effort."
