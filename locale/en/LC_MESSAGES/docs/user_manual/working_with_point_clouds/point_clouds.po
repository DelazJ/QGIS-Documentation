"A point cloud is a three-dimensional image of a space made up of many "
"individual of data points (up to billions, even trillions). Each of the "
"points has an x, y and z coordinate. Depending on the capture method, "
"point clouds usually also have additional attributes that came from the "
"capture, such as color values or intensity. These attributes can be used,"
" for instance, to display point clouds in different colors. In QGIS, a "
"point cloud can be used to generate a three-dimensional image of the "
"landscape (or of another space)."

"QGIS supports the data formats Entwine Point Tile (EPT) and LAS/LAZ. To "
"work with point clouds, QGIS always saves the data in EPT. EPT is a "
"storage format that consists of several files stored in a common folder. "
"To allow quick access to the data, EPT uses indexing. For more "
"information on the EPT format, see `entwine homepage <https://entwine.io/en/latest"

"If the data is in LAS or LAZ format, QGIS will convert it to EPT when it "
"is loaded for the first time. Depending on the size of the file, this may"
" take some time. In this process, a subfolder is created in the folder in"
" which the LAS/LAZ file is located according to the scheme :file:`ept_` +"
" :file:`name_LAS/LAZ_file`. If such a subfolder already exists, QGIS "
"loads the EPT immediately (which leads to a reduced loading time)."
