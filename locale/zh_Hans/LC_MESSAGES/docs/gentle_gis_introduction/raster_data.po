"A raster dataset is composed of rows (running across) and columns (running "
"down) of pixels (also know as cells). Each pixel represents a geographical "
"region, and the value in that pixel represents some characteristic of that "
"region."
msgstr "栅格数据由呈行（横向）列（纵向）状排列的像素（也称像元）组成。每个像素代表了一定的地理区域，其像元值代表该区域的某种属性。"

"Some features on a landscape are easy to represent as points, polylines and "
"polygons (e.g. trees, roads, houses). In other cases it can be difficult. "
"For example how would you represent the grasslands? As polygons? What about "
"the variations in colour you can see in the grass? When you are trying to "
"represent large areas with continuously changing values, raster data can be "
"a better choice."
msgstr ""
"有些地物（像树，道路和建筑）用点、线、面来表示比较简单，但别的就比较困难了。比如说草地要怎么表示？用面元素？那颜色的变化要怎么体现呢？当你需要表示这种大范围连续变化的区域的时候，用栅格数据可能会更好。"

"Using raster data is a solution to these problems. Many people use raster "
"data as a **backdrop** to be used behind vector layers in order to provide "
"more meaning to the vector information. The human eye is very good at "
"interpreting images and so using an image behind vector layers, results in "
"maps with a lot more meaning. Raster data is not only good for images that "
"depict the real world surface (e.g. satellite images and aerial "
"photographs), they are also good for representing more abstract ideas. For "
"example, rasters can be used to show rainfall trends over an area, or to "
"depict the fire risk on a landscape. In these kinds of applications, each "
"cell in the raster represents a different value e.g. risk of fire on a scale"
" of one to ten."

"使用栅格数据是解决这类问题的一个方法。因为人眼对于矢量数据后的图像信息是比较敏感的， "
"所以有很多人会在矢量数据的后面加上栅格的底图以丰富数据信息。除了用于表示真实地表（如卫星与航空遥感图像），栅格数据还可以用于表达更抽象的属性，例如区域内的降雨趋势，发生火灾的风险等。在这类应用中，栅格的每一个像元值都代表不同的涵义（如用一到十来衡量火灾风险等级）"
