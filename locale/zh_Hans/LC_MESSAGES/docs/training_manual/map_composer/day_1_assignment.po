"While customizing your map, keep asking yourself questions. Is this map easy"
" to read and understand for someone who's unfamiliar with the data? If I saw"
" this map on the Internet, or on a poster, or in a magazine, would it "
"capture my attention? Would I want to read this map if it wasn't mine?"

"在配置地图的同时，要不断地问自己问题。例如：对于不熟悉数据的人来说，这张地图是否容易阅读和理解？如果我在互联网、海报或杂志上看到这张地图，会不会吸引我的注意力？如果这张地图不是我制作的，我会想看吗？"

"If this course is being presented to you, the course presenter may require "
"you to submit a final version of your map, exported to PDF, for evaluation. "
"If you're doing this course by yourself, it's recommended that you evaluate "
"your own map using the same criteria. Your map will be evaluated on the "
"overall appearance and symbology of the map itself, as well as the "
"appearance and layout of the map page and elements.  Remember that the "
"emphasis for evaluating the appearance of maps will always be *ease of use*."
" The nicer the map is to look at and the easier it is to understand at a "
"glance, the better."

"如果向您讲解本课程，课程主持人可能会要求您提交地图的最终版本，导出为PDF以供评测。如果是独自学习本课程，建议您使用相同的标准评测自己的地图。您的地图将根据地图本身的整体外观和符号，以及地图页面和元素的外观和布局进行评测。请记住，评测地图外观的重点始终是"
" *易用性* 。地图越好看，容易一目了然，也就具有较高的价值。"
