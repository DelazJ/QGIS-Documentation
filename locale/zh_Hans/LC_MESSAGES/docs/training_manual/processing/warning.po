"Just like the manual of a word processor doesn't teach you how to write a "
"novel or a poem, or a CAD tutorial doesn't show you how to calculate the "
"size of a beam for a building, this guide will not teach you spatial "
"analysis. Instead, it will show you how to use the QGIS Processing "
"framework, a powerful tool for performing spatial analysis. It is up to you "
"to learn the required concepts that are needed to understand that type of "
"analysis. Without them, there is no point in using the framework and its "
"algorithms, although you might be tempted to try."

"就像文字处理软件的手册未教您如何写小说或诗歌，或者CAD教程没有教您如何计算建筑横梁的尺寸一样，本指南不会讲授空间分析。相反，将向您展示如何使用QGIS处理框架，这是执行空间分析的强大工具。您需要学习理解该类型分析所需的概念。没有这些，使用框架及其算法就无任何意义，尽管您可能会尝试一下。"

"Given a set of points and a value of a given variable value at each point, "
"you can calculate a raster layer from them using the *Kriging* geoalgorithm."
" The parameters dialog for that module is like the following one."

"By reading this manual, you will learn things such as how to use that "
"module, how to run it in a batch process to create raster layers from "
"hundreds of points layers in a single run, or what happens if the input "
"layer has some points selected. However, the parameters themselves are not "
"explained. A seasoned analyst with a good knowledge of geostatistics will "
"have no problem understanding those parameters. If you are not one of them "
"and *sill*, *range*, or *nugget* are not familiar concepts to you, then you "
"should not use the *Kriging* module. More than that, you are far from being "
"ready to use the *Kriging* module, since it requires learning about concepts"
" such as spatial autocorrelation or semivariograms, which probably you also "
"haven't heard before, or at least haven't studied long enough. You should "
"first study and understand them, and then come back to QGIS to actually run "
"it and perform the analysis. Ignoring this will result in wrong results and "
"poor (and most likely useless) analysis."
msgstr ""
"通过阅读本手册，您将学习如何使用该模块，如何在批处理过程中运行该模块一次性从数百个点图层创建栅格图层，或者如果输入图层选择了一些点，会发生什么情况。而这些参数本身并没有解释。熟悉地质统计学的经验丰富的分析师理解这些参数不会有问题。如果您不是其中一员，并且"
" *sill* 、 *range* 或 *nugget* 对您来说并不是很熟悉的概念，那么您不应该使用克里金模块。更重要的是，您还远远没有准备好使用 "
"*克里金* "
"模块，因为它需要学习空间自相关或半变异函数之类的概念，而这可能您以前也没有听说过，或者至少没有深入学习。应该首先研究和理解相关知识，然后回到QGIS实际运行并执行分析。忽视这一点将导致错误的结果和糟糕的"
" (很可能是无用的) 分析。"

"Although not all algorithms are as complex as kriging (but some of them are "
"even more complex!), almost all of them require understanding the "
"fundamental analysis ideas that they are based on. Without that knowledge, "
"using them will most likely lead to poor results."
msgstr ""
"虽然并非所有算法都像克里金算法那样复杂 "
"(其中一些算法甚至更复杂!)，几乎所有这些都需要理解所基于的基本分析理论。如果没有这些知识，盲目使用很可能会导致糟糕的结果。"

"Using geoalgorithms without having a good foundation of spatial analysis is "
"like trying to write a novel without knowing anything about grammar or "
"syntax, and having no knowledge about storytelling. You might get a result, "
"but it is likely to have no value at all.  Please, don't fool yourself and "
"think that after reading this guide you are already capable of performing "
"spatial analysis and get sound results. You need to study spatial analysis "
"as well."
msgstr ""
"在没有扎实的空间分析基础知识的情况下使用地理算法，就像试图写一本小说而不懂语法或句法，甚至不知道如何讲故事。您可能会得到一个结果，但它或许没有任何价值。请不要自欺欺人，不要以为在阅读了本指南之后，已经能够进行空间分析并获得理想的结果。您还需要学习空间分析相关知识。"
