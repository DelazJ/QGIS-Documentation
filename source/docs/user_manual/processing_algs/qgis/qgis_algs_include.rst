**network_advanced_parameters**

``Direction field`` [tablefield: string]
  Optional

  The field used to specify directions for the network edges.

  The values used in this field are specified with the three parameters ``Value for
  forward direction``, ``Value for backward direction`` and ``Value for both directions``.
  Forward and reverse directions correspond to a one-way edge, "both directions"
  indicates a two-way edge.

  If a feature does not have a value in this field, or no field is set then the
  default direction setting (provided with the ``Default direction`` parameter)
  is used.

``Value for forward direction`` [string]
  Optional

  Value set in the direction field to identify edges with a forward direction.

``Value for backward direction`` [string]
  Optional

  Value set in the direction field to identify edges with a backward direction.

``Value for both directions`` [string]
  Optional

  Value set in the direction field to identify bidirectional edges.

``Default direction`` [enumeration]
  If a feature has no value set in the direction field or if no direction field is set,
  then this direction value is used.

  Available options are:

  * 0 --- Forward direction
  * 1 --- Backward direction
  * 2 --- Both directions

  Default: *2*

``Speed field`` [tablefield: string]
  Optional

  Field providing the speed value (in ``km/h``) for the edges of the network when
  looking for the fastest path.

  If a feature does not have a value in this field, or no field is set then the
  default speed value (provided with the ``Default speed`` parameter) is used.

  ``Default speed (km/h)`` [number]
    Value to use to calculate the travel time if no speed field is provided for an edge.

    Default: *50.0*

  ``Topology tolerance`` [number]
    Two lines with nodes closer than the specified tolerance are considered connected.

    Default: *0.0*

 qgisselectbylocation, qgisextractbylocation
 
**geometric_predicates**

.. figure:: img/selectbylocation.png
   :align: center
       
   In this example, the dataset from which we want to select (the *source
   vector layer*) consists of the green circles, the orange rectangle is the
   dataset that it is being compared to (the *intersection vector layer*).

``Where the features (geometric predicate)`` [enumeration] [list]
  The spatial condition for the selection is defined by choosing one or more
  geometric predicates.

  *Intersect*
    Tests whether a geometry intersects another. Returns 1 (true) if the
    geometries spatially intersect (share any portion of space - overlap or touch) and 0 if they
    donâ€™t. In the picture above, this will select circles 1, 2 and 3.

  *Contain*
    Returns 1 (true) if and only if no points of b lie in the exterior of a,
    and at least one point of the interior of b lies in the interior of a.
    In the picture, no circle is selected, but the rectangle would be if you
    would select it the other way around, as it contains a circle completely.
    This is the opposite of *are within*.
    
  *Disjoint*
    Returns 1 (true) if the geometries do not share any portion of space (no overlap, not touching).
    Only circle 4 is selected.
    
  *Equal*
    Returns 1 (true) if and only if geometries are exactly the same.
    No circles will be selected.
    
  *Touch*
    Tests whether a geometry touches another. Returns 1 (true) if the geometries
    have at least one point in common, but their interiors do not intersect.
    Only circle 3 is selected.
      
  *Overlap*
    Tests whether a geometry overlaps another. Returns 1 (true) if the geometries
    share space, are of the same dimension, but are not completely contained by
    each other. Only circle 2 is selected.
    
  *Are within*
    Tests whether a geometry is within another. Returns 1 (true) if geometry a
    is completely inside geometry b. Only circle 1 is selected.
    
  *Cross*
    Returns 1 (true) if the supplied geometries have some, but not all, interior
    points in common and the actual crossing is of a lower dimension than the
    highest supplied geometry. For example, a line crossing a polygon will cross
    as a line (selected). Two lines crossing will cross as a point (selected).
    Two polygons cross as a polygon (not selected).

  Default: *Intersect*

.. The following section is included in database algorithms such as
 qgispostgisexecutesql, qgispostgisexecuteandloadsql
 
**postgisexecutesqlexample**

**Example**

#. Set all the values of an existing field to a fixed value. The SQL query string
   will be:

   .. code-block:: sql

    UPDATE your_table SET field_to_update=20;

   In the example above, the values of the field ``field_to_update`` of the table
   ``your_table`` will be all set to ``20``.

#. Create a new ``area`` column and calculate the area of each feature with the
   ``ST_AREA`` PostGIS function.

   .. code-block:: sql

    -- Create the new column "area" on the table your_table"
    ALTER TABLE your_table ADD COLUMN area double precision;
    -- Update the "area" column and calculate the area of each feature:
    UPDATE your_table SET area=ST_AREA(geom);

.. The following section is included in singleband pseudocolor of raster
 and contours symbology of mesh data
 
**singleband_pseudocolor**

Using a :guilabel:`Band` of the layer and a :ref:`values range <minmaxvalues>`,
three types of color :guilabel:`Interpolation` are available:

* Discrete (a <= symbol appears in the value column)
* Linear
* Exact (an equal symbol appears in the Value column)

The :guilabel:`Color ramp` drop down list lists the color ramp in your QGIS. You
can add a new one, edit or save the one you changed. The name of the color ramp
will be saved in the configuration and in the QML files.

The :guilabel:`Label unit suffix` is a label added after the value in the
legend.

For the classification :guilabel:`Mode` |selectString| 'Equal interval', you
only need to select the :guilabel:`number of classes` |selectNumber| and press
the button :guilabel:`Classify`.
In the case of the :guilabel:`Mode` |selectString| 'Continuous', QGIS creates
classes automatically depending on the :guilabel:`Min` and :guilabel:`Max`.

The button |signPlus| :sup:`Add values manually` adds a value
to the individual color table. The button |signMinus| :sup:`Remove selected row`
deletes a value from the individual color table. Double clicking on the value column
lets you insert a specific value. Double clicking on the color column opens the dialog
:guilabel:`Change color`, where you can select a color to apply on that value.
Further, you can also add labels for each color, but this value won't be displayed
when you use the identify feature tool.

You can use the buttons |fileOpen| :sup:`Load color map from file` or |fileSaveAs|
:sup:`Export color map to file` to load an existing color table or to save the
defined color table for other sessions.

The |checkbox| :guilabel:`Clip out of range values` allows QGIS to not render pixel
greater than the :guilabel:`Max` value.
